# BMX-Pos-Calc   
This project has been developed on Python using TKinter for GUI   
The aim of this project is to provide proper Risk Management to traders on Bitmex (crypto exchange).  
This app takes these variables as input:-   
1. BTC capital  
2. Entry Price  
3. Stop Loss  
4. Exit Price  
5. Risk in %  
  
Then it interacts with the Bitmex Rest API to get the latest XBTUSD price. Then it calculates and outputs the following:-   
1. Posoition Size   
2. Profit %   
 
An example of how to use this app is shown below :-

*Note that the negative sign in the position size and profit denote that it's a short position. When you are going long, those values will be positive.
